A data inventory and quality audit was conducted for all hydro-meteorological inputs used in the Lake Victoria water balance and dam outflow optimization analysis. The core daily datasets comprised lake-average precipitation (CHIRPS), lake evaporation, Victoria Nile outflows at Jinja, and observed lake levels at Jinja pier. The common overlapping period across these daily datasets was 2001-01-01 to 2021-04-27 (7,422 days), and this period was adopted as the primary calibration and evaluation window for the lake water balance model. Tributary inflows were provided as time series for 15 tributaries and will be standardized, audited for gaps, and combined into total lake inflow during subsequent preprocessing.
