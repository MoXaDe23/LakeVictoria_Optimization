Monthly tributary inflows for 15 Lake Victoria tributaries were available with varying record lengths. To obtain a continuous inflow series consistent with the daily lake water balance period (2001–2021), tributary flows were reconstructed using rainfall-informed methods. Tributaries with sufficient overlap were modeled using a regression relationship between monthly rainfall totals, lagged rainfall, and seasonality. Tributaries without overlap were represented using historical monthly climatology scaled by rainfall anomalies during the study period. The reconstructed monthly inflows were then disaggregated to daily flows using rainfall-weighted allocation, preserving monthly mean discharge while reflecting intra-month variability driven by rainfall.
