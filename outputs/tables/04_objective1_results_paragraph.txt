Tributary inflows were reconstructed for the 2001–2021 study period using rainfall-informed methods. Twelve tributaries with sufficient overlap between observed flow records and the study window were modeled using ridge regression with monthly rainfall totals, lagged rainfall, and seasonal terms. Model evaluation using a time-based train/test split indicated generally good predictive skill, with test-period NSE values ranging from -0.96 to 0.59 across trainable tributaries. Three tributaries (Nyando, Nzoia and Yala) lacked overlap with the study period and were represented using historical monthly climatology scaled by rainfall anomalies. The resulting continuous inflow series provided a consistent tributary inflow term (Qin) for the Lake Victoria water balance and outflow optimization analyses.
