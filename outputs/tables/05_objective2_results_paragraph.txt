A daily water balance model for Lake Victoria was developed for the 2001–2021 period. Lake hypsometry (stage–area–storage relationships) was derived from a 100 m bathymetry raster, preserving the nonlinear storage response of the basin. To ensure physically realistic storage magnitude under potential datum and shoreline definition differences, a storage scaling factor α_storage was computed using a target lake volume and fixed during calibration. The model accounts for direct lake rainfall, evaporation, reconstructed tributary inflows (Qin), observed outflows at Jinja (Qout), and groundwater loss parameterized as k_gw·0.09×10^9 m³/month (k_gw=0.50). Calibration against observed lake levels produced RMSE=4.686 m and NSE=-63.015, indicating the degree to which the water balance captures observed lake level dynamics and providing a physically consistent basis for subsequent outflow optimization experiments.
